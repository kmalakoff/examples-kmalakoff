[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/kmalakoff/examples-kmalakoff.png)](http://travis-ci.org/kmalakoff/examples-kmalakoff)

This project provided some interesting hopefully sometimes event fun examples of using some of my open source libraries on GitHub!

Current repositories:
  * Background.js: Background job / task / worker library. Provides implementations for jobs, a job queue, a job list, and single and multiple array iterators.
      -> https://github.com/kmalakoff/background

  * Backbone-Articulation.js: Add custom attribute serialization and deserialization to your Backbone.Models.
      -> https://github.com/kmalakoff/backbone-articulation
      -> Please note: until (or if!) my changes don't get updated into the main branch, you'll need to use this branch of Backbone.js: https://github.com/kmalakoff/backbone

  * Mixin.js: The 'reuse more' Javascript nano-framework. Stay DRY...mixin!
      -> https://github.com/kmalakoff/mixin

  * Underscore-Awesomer.js: Awesome add-ons for Underscore.js.
      -> https://github.com/kmalakoff/underscore-awesomer
